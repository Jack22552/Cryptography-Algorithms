# Cryptography-Algorithms
Jack Salinas

This repository contains three cryptography projects completed. Each project builds foundational and advanced cryptographic tools entirely from scratch, with a strong emphasis on modular arithmetic, number theory, and digital security protocols. All code was written in Python, without the use of external cryptography libraries.

P1: RSA Cryptosystem
Topics Covered: Integer factorization, Eulerâ€™s theorem, Modular inverses and fast exponentiation, ASCII encoding of text into integers, 

What I Learned: How RSA relies on the hardness of factoring large integers, The importance of modular arithmetic and multiplicative inverses, How digital signatures ensure message authenticity and integrity.

P2: MV-ElGamal (Elliptic Curve ElGamal Encryption)
Topics Covered: ElGamal encryption on elliptic curves, Public key cryptography using EC groups, Curve arithmetic: point addition and scalar multiplication, Ciphertext compression (x-coordinate only)

What I Learned: How elliptic curves can provide stronger security with smaller keys, Curve arithmetic and group operations over Zp field, How ElGamal encryption works geometrically on elliptic curves, Techniques to optimize ciphertext representation without loss of security.

P3: Digital Signatures (ElGamal & ECDSA)
Topics Covered: ElGamal signature scheme over Zp* field, ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms, Hashless signature schemes using message integers, Public verification and signature forgery resistance

What I Learned: The critical role of digital signatures in verifying identity and data integrity, How randomness is essential for signature security (e.g. avoiding reused nonces), How elliptic curves are used in real-world systems like Bitcoin, Differences between encryption and authentication protocols

Final Takeaways:
Across all three projects, I gained deep, hands-on experience in:
- Implementing cryptographic protocols from scratch

- Using modular arithmetic and number theory in real-world contexts

- Working with both classical and modern cryptographic schemes

- Understanding the mathematical foundations behind public-key systems

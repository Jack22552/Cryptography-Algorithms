This project implements a variant of Elliptic Curve ElGamal encryption known as Menezes–Vanstone ElGamal (MV-ElGamal) from scratch. The implementation includes:

Elliptic curve arithmetic over a finite field 𝑍𝑝
​
Generation of elliptic curves and valid points

Key generation for MV-ElGamal

Encryption and decryption of messages using both the standard and compressed versions of the MV-ElGamal scheme

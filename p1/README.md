This project implements the RSA public-key cryptosystem entirely from scratch. It includes everything from primality testing and key generation to encryption, decryption, and theoretical analysis. No external libraries were used for cryptographic functions, all core components were hand-built to deepen understanding of the RSA algorithm and its underlying number theory.

Features:
Fast modular exponentiation and extended Euclidean algorithm

ASCII-to-integer encoding/decoding for plaintext messages

Implementation of the RSA problem

Probabilistic primality testing using the Miller-Rabin algorithm

Prime generation over specific bounds and bit lengths

RSA key pair generation with customizable key size (bit length)

Full RSA encryption and decryption pipeline

Communication via public key sharing and message recovery

Theoretical exploration of RSA's security and its dependence on integer factorization

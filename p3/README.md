This project implements two major digital signature schemes from scratch:

ElGamal Digital Signature Scheme over Zp*

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

The project includes key generation, message signing, signature verification, and tests using provided data.

All cryptographic logic is implemented from scratch without using external crypto libraries.

Randomness is handled with secure random number generation where needed.

Signature schemes are tested for correctness against known values and real-world parameters (e.g., Bitcoin).
